Programming Interfaces for integrating HPC and DA/ML workflows
==============================================================



TODO: Write an overview of the motivation and the idea of software invocation and
data transformations.

For this first iteration, we have defined the software invocation descriptions and
we have extended the PyCOMPSs programming model and runtime. Next versions of the
eFlows4HPC framework will include the definition of the data transformations and
their implementation.
