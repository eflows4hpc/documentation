======

The `Distributed Computing Library`_ (dislib) is a library that provides various distributed machine-learning algorithms.
It has been implemented on top of `PyCOMPSs`_, with the goal of facilitating the execution of big data
analytics algorithms in distributed platforms, such as clusters, clouds, and supercomputers.

Dislib comes with two primary programming interfaces: an API to manage data in a distributed way and an estimator-based interface to work with different
machine learning models.

Dislib main data structure is the distributed array (ds-array) that enables to distribute the data sets in multiple nodes of a computing infrastructure. The
typical workflow in dislib consists of the following steps:

* Reading input data into a ds-array.

* Creating an estimator object.

* Fitting the estimator with the input data.

* Getting information from the modelâ€™s estimator or applying the model to new data.
