Ophidia
=======

Ophidia is a CMCC Foundation research effort addressing Big Data challenges for eScience. The Ophidia framework represents an open source solution for the analysis of scientific multi-dimensional data, joining HPC paradigms and Big Data approaches. It provides an environment targeting High Performance Data Analytics (HPDA) through *parallel* and *in-memory data processing, data-driven task scheduling* and *server-side analysis*. The framework exploits an array-based storage model, leveraging the datacube abstraction from OLAP systems, and a hierarchical storage organisation to partition and distribute large multi-dimensional scientific datasets over multiple nodes. Ophidia is primarily used in the climate change domain, although it has also been successfully exploited in other scientific domains.
