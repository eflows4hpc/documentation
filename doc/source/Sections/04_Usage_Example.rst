This section describes how to implement, deploy and execute
a workflow using the eFlows4HPC Software Stack. As example we use a one of the worklfows implemented in the Pillar I during the first year of the project.

Pillar I: Reduced Order Model workflow
--------------------------------------
This workflow has the objective of generating a Reduced-Order Model (ROM) from the data generated by Full Order Model simulations (FOM). The HPC FOM simulations are performed with the Kratos Multiphysics are combined with distributed Machine learning algorithms implemented with the dislib. The input for this simulations are available in HTTP repository, and we desire to upload the generated Reduce Order Model in B2DROP repository in order to be available for final users.

The following sections describe the different steps to implement, deploy and execute the Reduce Order Model workflow using the eFlows4HPC methodologies:

  - `Step 1 <04_Usage_Example/PyCOMPSs_workflow.rst>`: Implement the computational workflow integrating different computations using the eFlows4HPC programming interfaces.
  - `Step 2 <04_Usage_Example/Enable_Container_Image_creation.rst>`: Enable the HPC ready container image creation by including the workflow software requirements.
  - `Step 3 <04_Usage_Example/Data_Logistics_Pipeline.rst>`: Implement data logistic pipelines to manage the movements of workflow data between  the parallel file system of HPC clusters and external data repositories.
  - `Step 4 <04_Usage_Example/TOSCA_Description>`: Integrate the different workflow parts in TOSCA application
  - `Step 5 <04_Usage_Example/Workflow_Deployment>`: Deploy the workflow to an HPC clusters using Alien4Cloud and make it accessible to users
  - `Step 6 <04_Usage_Example/Workflow_Execution>`: Configure the credentials and Execute the workflow with the HPCWaaS execution API
